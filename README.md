# 👨‍💼 Employee Attrition and Retention Analysis

### 🔍 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting employee attrition using data-driven insights. By exploring workplace patterns, satisfaction levels, and performance factors, the goal is to identify why employees leave and how organizations can improve retention.

The dataset contains detailed information on 59,598 employees, including demographics, job role, work-life balance, performance ratings, and more. Using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques, this project uncovers trends and builds predictive models for attrition risk.

### 📂 Dataset Description
- **Total Records:** 59,598  
- **Total Features:** 24  
- **Target Variable:** `Attrition` (`Left` / `Stayed`)  

**Key Columns:**
- `Age`, `Gender`, `Job Role`, `Monthly Income`
- `Job Satisfaction`, `Work-Life Balance`, `Performance Rating`
- `Number of Promotions`, `Education Level`, `Company Size`
- `Remote Work`, `Employee Recognition`, `Company Reputation`

This dataset provides a holistic view of employee characteristics and workplace conditions that influence retention.

### ⚙️ Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection** – Using the given dataset (`train.csv`).  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and normalization.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Uncovering patterns, correlations, and visual insights.  
4. **Feature Engineering** – Creating meaningful features for model training.  
5. **Model Building** – Training classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.) to predict attrition.  
6. **Visualization Dashboard (Optional)** – Creating an interactive Power BI or Python-based dashboard.  
7. **Evaluation & Insights** – Summarizing the key drivers of attrition and retention strategies.

### 💡 Key Insights
- Employees with **poor work-life balance** and **low job satisfaction** show a higher tendency to leave.  
- **Overtime** and **lack of promotions** are strong indicators of attrition.  
- **Mid-level employees** have a higher turnover rate compared to entry-level staff.  
- Remote work flexibility and recognition programs help **reduce attrition risk**.  

---

### 📈 Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn  
- **Visualization Tools:** Power BI / Tableau / Matplotlib  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  

---

### 🚀 Future Scope
- Implement a real-time **Attrition Prediction Dashboard**.  
- Integrate **Machine Learning APIs** for HR analytics systems.  
- Perform **Sentiment Analysis** on employee feedback.  
- Extend dataset with **departmental** and **geographical** factors.

---

### 🙌 Conclusion
This project helps organizations understand **why employees leave** and what actions can improve **retention and engagement**.  
By applying data analytics, businesses can build more supportive and productive workplaces.
